          <br>
         <p class="fls_p">The Anchorage forms an important part of the Fall Protection System. In the event of movement at height, along the vertical or a horizontal axis, we require an Anchorage System that spans across this movement. The Fixed Line Systems are such specially engineered systems. 
          It is important to understand that the Forces experienced over the system and the underlying structures in the event of a fall, are extremely complex to calculate and define. It is here that B9 ENGINEERS offers exceptional expertise to combat the problem. B9 ENGINEERS has a dedicated Team of trained Engineers who, by virtue of their experience and knowledge, are able to suggest optimal solutions for the requirement of FLS.</p>
          <br>

          <h4 class="fls_h4">This offers the following advantage to the Client :</h4>
          <br>
          <ul class="fls_ul">
                  <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Provide a safe solution for anchorage.</li> <br>
                  <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Optimize the cost of the solution through Engineered products.</li> <br>
                  <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;Safeguard the underlying structure on which the Line is installed.</li> <br>
          </ul> 
          <br>
          <p class="fls_p">B9 ENGINEERS uses the latest Design software like CAD and Structural Design Software like StaadPro to accurately design the Anchorage Line System and simulate the forces in the event of a fall.</p> 
          <br> 
          <p class="fls_p">It is also extremely important for the Client to be confident of the system installed. Team B9 ENGINEERS uses specialized Onsite Testing and Proof-loading Equipment from HydraJaws UK, to provide this specialized service. </p>  
          <p class="fls_p">B9 ENGINEERS also provides services for Annual on-site Inspection and Revalidation of these Systems.</p>  
          <br>
           <h4 class="fls_h4">Why is Revalidation of Fall Protection Equipment important ?</h4>
          <br>
          <p class="fls_p">Fall Protection Equipment are life saving products. As per EN 365 of PPE Directives, it is mandatory to have a ‘Competent Authority’ inspect the Fall Protection Equipment at least once annually.</p>
